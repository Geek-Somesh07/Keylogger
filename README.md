# 🛡️ Python Keylogger

A lightweight and educational Python-based keylogger designed for **ethical use only**, such as penetration testing, security research, or parental control—**with explicit permission and legal compliance**.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This project is for **educational and ethical testing purposes only**. Unauthorized usage of a keylogger is illegal and unethical. Ensure you have consent before using this software.

## ✅ Features

- 🎯 Captures keystrokes in the background
- 🗂 Logs keystrokes to a local file
- 🕵️‍♂️ Runs silently in the system tray (optional)
- 🛠 Minimal setup, pure Python implementation
- 📤 (Optional) Auto-email or upload logs (coming soon)

## 📦 Installation

> Requires Python 3.6+

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-keylogger.git
   cd python-keylogger
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## 🛠 Usage

1. Run the keylogger script:
   ```bash
   python keylogger.py
   ```

2. Logs will be saved in the `/logs` directory with timestamped filenames.

3. To stop the keylogger, use `Ctrl+C` in the terminal or stop the script from the task manager.
